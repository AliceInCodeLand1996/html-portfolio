<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a High school graduate who finished a sort of greek trade school known as ΙΕΚ as a nursing assistant.
  One of the biggest mistakes of my life. I never knew what I wanted to do with my life so eventually I thought hey 
  let's give coding a try. So I was wondering where do I begin.</p>

<p>So in short I started my coding journey through a course on UDEMY that belongs to Angela Yu and I have to say
  I am grateful to finally have found something that reignited my passion for learning something new.</p>

<p>Besides my new hobby of learning coding and programming, I am a sporty guy.
  I enjoy frequent gym sessions of strength conditioning, running for endurance and doing MDS exercises with 
  a friend of mine (MDS stands for Mastro Defence System). It's a defensive street fighting style that teaches you 
  how to stop a fight in a second before it ever begins.
